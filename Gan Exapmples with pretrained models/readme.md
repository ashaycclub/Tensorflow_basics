## Generative Adverserial Network Models

* Model parameters can be tuned to get even better results

1. The code.py file runs the training process and saves the model after every 10 epoch to compare the performance.

2. The run.py file is used to generate new output images using the trained models.

3. The images folder consists of all the images generated during the training process for comparison purposes.
