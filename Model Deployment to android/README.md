## The code covers all the basics with code implementations on how to deploy a Deep Learning Model To android . 

* It also tells conversion of a Keras model to tensorflow Mobile (.pb) file.

### The process overview is as belows :

* save the model as model_name.h5

* import tensorflow as a backend

* Freeze the graph 

* write the model to disk using tf_FileWriter.

<br>

Now, the model is ready with a '.pb' file .  

* Write the java code for the interface of the app .
* code other necessary files as reuired for the android 
* Use all the files to  build your proect in the android studio.
